REminiscence libretro for Switch
=====================

Swithc port of Gregory Montoir's Flashback emulator, running as a libretro core.

## Info

This port is still a work in progress, however it is in a working state. 
Currently, it jumps directly into the game, skipping the main menu.

## Running the game

* Place game files in their own /data/ folder in the same directory as REminiscence-nx.nro
* When loading game content, load "level1.map"

## Music

* Music is supported but must be loaded from Amiga .mod files
* Files must be named mod.flashback-xxxx and placed in the /data/ directory
